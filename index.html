            <ul>
                <li>
                    Out of these restaurants, I find that the one I come to the most
                    ends up being Crazy Mexico as I always end up getting the Texas ACP.
                    It's just so good!
                </li>

                <li>
                    By the way, every Tuesdays and Thursdays Crazy Mexico runs a really nice deal
                    where if you bring your student ID and show them you can get 10% off of that meal!
                </li>
